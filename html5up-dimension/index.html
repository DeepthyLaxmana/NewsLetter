								<p>
									It is my pleasure to present the Soarian AMS, CAS and Client Support Q1 & Q2 2020 Newsletter. The publication of the newsletter was put 
on hold at the end of teh first quarter as we were in the very begining stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Little did we know what we were all in store
for... we were attempting to navigate everyone working at home, trying to find balance between work/home life and some sort of normalcy, enduring the fear and 
uncertainty of potentially contracting the virus, and working diligently to helo our clients stay ahead of the pending insurmountable 
impacts of this awful virus. The term 'Unprecedented Times' doesn't seem quite accurate enough. Please take a few minutes and review all of the 
great information provided herein. This publication is dedicated to each and every one of who has done a tremendous job over the past 2 
quaters adjusting to our 'new normal' and navigating any/all challenges you faced, be they personal or professional. enjoy the read!
								</br></br>
Thank you for everything you do for Cerner and our clients!</br></br>
Best,</br>
Pam

  <p>Received high praise from Peconic during SSO quarterly report out “AMS is best investment we ever made”
  </br>
	Collaborated with Ballad Health to resolve patient safety concerns within the clients MED/IV processes by expediting several complex configuration changes across the clients system.

		SF/S2 - Northwell went live on 4/26/2020. Post live they experienced a Scheduling performance issue.  Support/CWx/IP collaborated to inactivate millions of Rules rows.  Client was pleased with work effort.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="warning">
	<p>
		Responded to COVID-19 challenges with above & beyond focus - expedited implementation of Critical Care beds (waiving license fees) for NWH and Ballad in 4 days which is typically a 6 week  install. AMS, Consulting, CIS-CS, Legal, and Contract Management worked together. 
	</br>
		Below is what clients had to say:
	</br>
		“Ballad thanks you for all you did to get us up and running.  It takes a village to get this crisis related needed work done. Your help in making access available a few hours before doors opened was phenomenal.  The CNO for that facility breathed a sigh of relief that this was one less thing off her list to worry about.   You guys rock.”
	</br>
		I wanted to thank you and yours for exception work and collaboration about helping make our Cerner Soarian instance ready for our COVID19 patient care. The Cerner all joined together and accomplished great and collaborative work in short time line while balancing any number of other clients’ needs at the same time. On behalf of UWMC Northwest, please accept our thanks.

		Invision – At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Northwell was scrambling to meet state mandates to increase bed capacity by 40% across campuses. This also required the beds to be quickly added to the Invision PA system. The Invision team responded to dozens of requests, many over weekends, to create 1,700+ beds across the 24 sites. The bed capacity increase is highlighted on the Northwell web site. We received multiple testimonials from the client for this effort.
